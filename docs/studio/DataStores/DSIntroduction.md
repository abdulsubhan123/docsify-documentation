## DataStores

A data store is a repository for persistently storing and managing collections of data which include not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types such as simple files, emails etc.[1]

A database is a series of bytes that is managed by a database management system (DBMS). A file is a series of bytes that is managed by a file system. Thus, any database or file is a series of bytes that, once stored, is called a data store.

MATLAB[2] and Cloud Storage systems like VMware,[3] Firefox OS[4] use datastore as a term for abstracting collections of data inside their respective applications.
